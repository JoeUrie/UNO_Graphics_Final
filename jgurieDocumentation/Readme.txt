Interactions:
The goal of the game is to have zero cards in your hand.
You can only play one card a turn, and it must match either the color, or the value of the card on the table.
Wildcards can be played whenever, as long as it's your turn.
End your turn by playing a card. You must draw until you can play a card.
Press 'R' to reset the entire program. Make sure to reset before starting a new game.
Press 't' to see a close up view of the table.
The rest of the controls can be accessed through the sub-menus.
